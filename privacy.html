      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>
        Last Updated: 3/13/2025<br />
        This Privacy Policy explains how our website (“we,” “us,” or “our”)
        handles information when you visit our site and use our services.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Our website itself does not collect, store, or process any personal
        information. Instead, when you proceed to make a purchase or payment,
        you are redirected to our third-party payment processor, Stripe.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Third-Party Payment Processor</h2>
      <p>
        Stripe is our trusted payment partner that securely collects and
        processes your personal information for payment transactions. The
        information collected by Stripe may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name</li>
        <li>Your email address</li>
        <li>Your phone number</li>
        <li>Credit card details</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We recommend reviewing Stripe’s own Privacy Policy for detailed
        information on how your data is managed and protected. You can find
        Stripe’s Privacy Policy on their official website.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        While our website does not store any personal data, Stripe employs
        industry-standard security measures to ensure that your information is
        processed securely. We are not responsible for the data security
        practices of Stripe. Please refer to Stripe’s policies and security
        statements for more details.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
        posted on this page, and the “Last Updated” date at the top will be
        revised accordingly. We encourage you to review this policy
        periodically.
      </p>
